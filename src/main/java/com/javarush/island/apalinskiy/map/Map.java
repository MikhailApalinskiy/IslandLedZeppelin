/**
 * Represents the core simulation map consisting of a two-dimensional grid of {@link Cell} objects.
 * <p>
 * The map dimensions are fixed at {@code length = 100} and {@code width = 20}, forming a 100Ã—20 grid.
 * Each cell is initialized via {@link #initializeMap()}, which populates the {@code map} array with new {@code Cell} instances.
 * <p>
 * This class serves as the central structure for storing and accessing simulation state, and is shared
 * across worker threads during the simulation's step-by-step execution.
 * <p>
 * Thread-safety is ensured not through internal synchronization in this class,
 * but via the external control flow of the simulation (e.g., {@link java.util.concurrent.Phaser}).
